# ID Distribution Analyzer

This Python script processes a large CSV file to calculate the distribution of unique IDs in the first column, including their counts and percentages. The results are saved to a smaller CSV file for further analysis.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- `pandas` library

Install the required libraries with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Place in the same location as the csv file and provide the file name at the beginning of the script.
Results are in id_distribution.csv
